# string-calculator-TDD
this is a node and ts project
for test cases I have used Jest framweork
test cases are placed src/tests folder - general recommended practice
Followed TDD for this task
commits are there for each and every step for test driven development
for running this below are the steps:-

1. npm install
2. npm run test

Jest gives code coverage as well , that will be generated under coverage folder once we run test cases
